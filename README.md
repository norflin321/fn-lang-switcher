# THE PROBLEM:

Not only its slow, but when mouse cursor happens to be in the center of the screen, it selects the wrong language for you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
# THE SOLUTION (get rid of the pop up):

Install ["issw"](https://github.com/vovkasm/input-source-switcher) a small utility for macos to switch input sources from a command line.
------------

    git clone https://github.com/norflin321/input-source-switcher.git
    cd input-source-switcher
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

By default executable will be installed as `/usr/local/bin/issw`

Create fn.py file in ~/. Or clone the repository. 
------------

    import os
    from pynput import keyboard

    def on_press(key):
        key_str = '{0}'.format(key)
        if (key_str == '<179>'):
            stream = os.popen('/usr/local/bin/issw')
            output = stream.read().strip() 
            if (output == 'com.apple.keylayout.ABC'):
                os.system('/usr/local/bin/issw com.apple.keylayout.Russian')
            else:
                os.system('/usr/local/bin/issw com.apple.keylayout.ABC')


    with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=None) as listener:
        listener.join()
`<179>` is key code for `fn`. Don't forget to run `issw -l` in terminal to get list of available input sources and modify script above if needed!

Set this to "Do Nothing"

Setup auto run of the script every time you log in (python3 should be installed).
------------
1. Install `pynput` python module:
    `/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install pynput`
or, if you are using your own python installation:
    `/your/python3/executable/path -m pip install pynput`
2. Inside `fn.plist` file, change paths to the python executable (if you are using custom python installation) and the script file. Mine is `/Users/norflin/fn.py`. Paths should be full.
3. Copy the plist file to special directory: `cp -R fn.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
4. Then run this command: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/fn.plist` - it will tell mac to run this file every time you log in. If you want to stop it run `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/fn.plist` and remove the file `rm -rf ~/Library/LaunchAgents/fn.plist`.
5. Mac might ask you to grant permission for python to monitor input from your keyboard and `Accessibility`. Generally macOS asking about `Input Monitoring`, add your python3 executable to `Accessibility` if no popup with this showed.
6. Restart. Log in. It should work.

P.S. Don't forget to reinstall `pynput` after upgrades. Also see [issue #2](https://github.com/norflin321/fn-lang-switcher/issues/2).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
# RESULT:
You can toggle input source with "fn" button, but without showing the pop up!
